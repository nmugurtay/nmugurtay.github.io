title: Reddit Flair Predictor
summary: An end-to-end machine learning project where I performed data collection, data analysis, built and deployed a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model. Analysed Reddit data to predict which flair(category) a post would belong to by submitting the URL of the post. Created a front-end using HTML, CSS and JS and the model was deployed using Flask and Docker.
