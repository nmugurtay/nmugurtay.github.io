title: Econometrics Term Project
summary: Solved two real-world problems using Data Collection and Econometrics on Stata. The first problem involved identifying whether the an aptitude test which is conducted before a course is good enough to predict the course outcome for each student in the class. The second problem was solved using the **Educational Attainment and Wage Equations** dataset to see if there were any differences in the educational attainment of males and females and how closely was it related to their race. I received an A grade in the course.
